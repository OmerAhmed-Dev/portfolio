Hey there! I'm a passionate security researcher and developer with a focus on offensive security and CTF competitions. I love breaking things (legally) and finding creative ways to bypass security measures.

## My Journey

I started my journey in cybersecurity through CTF competitions, where I discovered my passion for hacking and problem-solving. What began as a hobby quickly evolved into a career dedicated to making the digital world more secure.

## What I Do

- **Penetration Testing**: Helping organizations identify vulnerabilities before the bad guys do
- **CTF Competitions**: Regularly participating in Capture The Flag events to sharpen my skills
- **Security Research**: Discovering and responsibly disclosing vulnerabilities
- **Tool Development**: Building custom security tools and automation scripts
- **Technical Writing**: Sharing knowledge through detailed write-ups and tutorials

## Philosophy

I believe in the hacker mindset - always questioning, always learning, and always pushing boundaries. Security isn't just about finding bugs; it's about understanding systems at a fundamental level and thinking like an attacker to build better defenses.

## Let's Connect

I'm always interested in collaborating on interesting projects, discussing security topics, or just connecting with fellow enthusiasts. Feel free to reach out!
